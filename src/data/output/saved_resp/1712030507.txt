To achieve the tasks you've mentioned using the `python-pptx` library, you'll need to perform two distinct operations. First, let's see how to get the layout index from an existing slide. Then, we'll look at how to move a slide to a new position within the presentation.

### Getting the Layout Index from a Slide

The `python-pptx` library does not directly expose a method to get the layout index of a slide. However, you can compare the slide's layout with the layouts in the master to find a match. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from pptx import Presentation

def get_slide_layout_index(slide):
    for idx, layout in enumerate(slide.slide_layouts):
        if slide.layout == layout:
            return idx
    return None

# Load an existing presentation
prs = Presentation('your_presentation.pptx')

# Get the first slide (for example)
slide = prs.slides[0]

# Get the layout index of the first slide
layout_index = get_slide_layout_index(slide)
print(f"Layout Index: {layout_index}")
```

### Moving a Slide to a New Position

The `python-pptx` library does not provide a direct method to reorder slides. However, you can achieve this by manipulating the underlying XML. Here's a function that moves a slide to a new position:

```python
def move_slide(presentation, old_index, new_index):
    xml_slides = presentation.slides._sldIdLst  # Access the underlying XML structure
    slides = list(xml_slides)
    slide = slides[old_index]
    xml_slides.remove(slide)
    xml_slides.insert(new_index, slide)

# Load an existing presentation
prs = Presentation('your_presentation.pptx')

# Example: Move the first slide (index 0) to the third position (index 2)
move_slide(prs, 0, 2)

# Save the modified presentation
prs.save('modified_presentation.pptx')
```

Please note that manipulating the underlying XML structure directly can be risky if you're not familiar with the `python-pptx` internals or the PowerPoint file format. Always make sure to back up your original files before attempting such operations.

These examples assume you have a basic understanding of how to work with files and the `python-pptx` library. Remember to replace `'your_presentation.pptx'` and `'modified_presentation.pptx'` with the actual paths to your presentation files.
