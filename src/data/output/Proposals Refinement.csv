"Hello and thank you for considering my proposal. To achieve your goal of handling large amounts of OpenAI API requests I suggest employing parallel processing in Python. This will allow requests to be sent to the API as fast as possible, limited only by OpenAI's rate limits, networking latency, database latency and the processing power of the machine running the Python script. Rate limiting will be incorporated to respect OpenAI's rules and also to prevent failed requests due to rate limit errors. Selecting and inserting to the database will be handled using ORM in Python.

I have already implemented parallel processing for OpenAI API calls in the past, providing a 650% increase in performance. The project this was achieved on is showcased in the profile highlights below. This was on a smaller scale so your results may vary.

I look forward to meeting you,
